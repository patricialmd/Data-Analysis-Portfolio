# Data Analyst Portfolio

## About
Hi, I'm Patricia! I'm a Data Analytics graduate bringing data skills into aged care. For me, data is not just rows and numbers, it is most powerful when used ethically and purposefully in protecting the people we love. I've built work experience through customer service roles, remote freelancing with 30+ small businesses across three continents, data internship, and hands-on projects in Python, R, SQL, Tableau, and Power BI, with a strong focus on data cleaning as it is the foundation of any meaningful analysis. This is a repository to showcase my projects in aged care, showing how data and tech can improve the daily lives of the elderly.

## Why Aged Care?

### Growing Up in the Philippines

I grew up in a working-class family in the Philippines where both my parents were government employees. My dad retired as a registrar at a government university, and my mom as an auditor of government agencies. They taught me that accurate data affects real lives, a lesson that would later shape my career path.

As I got older and watched my parents age, I realised the biggest challenge was not just getting older. It was the system. In the last days of my dad's life, he was hospitalised and the bills were piling up. Healthcare in the Philippines was unaffordable, and there was no proper support for aging with dignity. Quality of life in senior years depended on whether you had money, not on data-driven care.

### Going to Australia and Discovering Aged Care

When I came to Australia as an international student, I learned about the country's healthcare and aged care systems through news and my sister's stories such as structured support, health monitoring, and government subsidies. My sister and her family had access to free healthcare as citizens. My mom didn't have the same access. That gap made me realise that while I can't change systems overnight, I could use data to build small but meaningful tools that directly improve the safety and independence of seniors. Through the small aged care projects that I did, I realised something powerful: **data could be the foundation of better care**.

### My Commitment

I saw how smarter systems and data-driven tools could better support older people and improve their quality of care. **This portfolio represents my commitment to using data to give seniors the proactive, dignified care my father never had access to.**

### Project Summary:  
| Project Name | Tools Used | Project Description |
|----------|----------|----------|
| [📱  **Wide Awake: Fire Prediction Mobile App Prototype**](https://github.com/patricialmd/fire_prediction_app_prototype_elderly) | JustInMind, Microsoft Word | Researched, conceptualised, and designed a mobile app prototype for the elderly that detects fire and smoke in real-time using a YOLOv2 AI model and alerts seniors and their carers through sound alarms, messaging, and GPS tracking. Built as a university project with a focus on elderly-centred UI/UX design. Because for seniors, especially those living alone, a few seconds of early warning can save a life. |
| [👞 **Mom's Step Count Analysis**](https://github.com/patricialmd/step-count-analysis) | Python, Jupyter Notebook | Analysed 393 days of my mom's Fitbit step count data merged with Sydney weather data to find out what drives her daily walking patterns. Because understanding what slows seniors down is the first step to keeping them active and independent. |
| [💹 **Aged Care Safety & Risk Monitoring Analytics**](https://github.com/patricialmd/aged-care-safety-analytics) | Python, SQL, Microsoft Excel, Power BI | Built an end-to-end data analytics project analysing 1,000 resident profiles, 365,000 daily health records, and 608 safety incidents across 6 major Australian cities, from synthetic dataset generation in Python to SQL analysis, Excel pivot reporting, and an interactive Power BI dashboard. Because in aged care, waiting until something goes wrong is not good enough. |
