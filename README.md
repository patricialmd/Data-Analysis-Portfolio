# Data Analyst Portfolio

## About
Hi, I'm Patricia! I'm a Data Analytics graduate bringing data skills into aged care. 

For me, data is not just rows and numbers, it is most powerful when used ethically and purposefully in protecting the people we love.

I've built work experience through customer service roles, freelancing with 30+ small businesses across three continents, data internship, and hands-on projects in Python, R, SQL, Tableau, and Power BI, with a strong focus on data cleaning as it is the foundation of any meaningful analysis.

This is a repository to showcase my projects in aged care, where I believe data-driven tools can directly improve the lives of seniors.

### Project Summary:  
| Project Name | Tools Used | Project Description 
|----------|----------|----------|----------|
| 📱  **Wide Awake: Fire Prediction Mobile App Prototype**| JustInMind, Microsoft Word, Microsoft PowerPoint | Researched, conceptualised, and designed a mobile app prototype for the elderly that detects fire and smoke in real-time using a YOLOv2 AI model and alerts seniors and their carers through sound alarms, messaging, and GPS tracking. Built as a university project with a focus on elderly-centred UI/UX design. Because for seniors, especially those living alone, a few seconds of early warning can save a life. |

| 👞 **Mom's Step Count Analysis**| Python, Jupyter Notebook | Analysed 393 days of my mom's Fitbit step count data merged with Sydney weather data to find out what drives her daily walking patterns. Because understanding what slows seniors down is the first step to keeping them active and independent. |

| 💹 **Aged Care Safety & Risk Monitoring Analytics** | Python, SQL, Microsoft Excel, Power BI | Built an end-to-end data analytics project analysing 1,000 resident profiles, 365,000 daily health records, and 608 safety incidents across 6 major Australian cities, from synthetic dataset generation in Python to SQL analysis, Excel pivot reporting, and an interactive Power BI dashboard. Because in aged care, waiting until something goes wrong is not good enough. |
